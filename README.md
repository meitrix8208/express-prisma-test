# express-prisma-test

This repository contains a server built with Express.js that is designed to test the functionality of Prisma. Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that allows developers to interact with databases using a type-safe and intuitive API.

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode.

For more information on how to use Prisma with Express, check out the official documentation: <https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart-typescript>.

Happy coding!
